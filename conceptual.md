  and from the server side using a library like `requests`?
  AJAX doesn't have to involve Flask.  It can be faster because the browser is talking directly to the API.  Making requests from the server side (Flask) is easier when you need to store the data in a SQL database.  The server side is also necessary when you need a password to access the API, because then you can keep the password private.

  To hide form fields that user is not goign to change or view.  It is a way of sending data along with a form that you want the server to have.  CSRF tokens are hidden by using the `form.hidden_tag()`.
